## :smiley: Hi...! :wave:	
This is the DBSCAN Clustering Application Program .
The application is clustering the cities based on pollution.
The Dataset used here is Indias state wise air quality data tamil nadu
You can find the data sets [here](https://www.kaggle.com/jamescalap/indias-state-wise-air-quality-data-tamil-nadu) (and also attached in Repository)

## Let us have a quick overview of DBSCAN in short:pinching_hand::

   - DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise 
  
   - Density-based clustering locates regions of high density that are separated from one another by regions of low density.
    
   - DBSCAN is a simple and effective density-based clustering algorithm 
  
   - The center-based approach to density allows us to classify a point as being,
      - In the interior of a dense region (a core point) 
      - On the edge of a dense region (a border point)
      - In a sparsely occupied region (a noise or background point) 
    
   - Core points: These points are in the interior of a density-based cluster. A point is a core point if the number of points within a given neighborhood around the point as 
      determined by the distance function and a user specified distance parameter, Eps, exceeds a certain threshold, MinPts.
      -Any two core points that are close enough-within a distance Eps of one another-are put in the same cluster.
    
   - Border points: A border point is not a core point but falls within the neighborhood of a core point.
  
   - Noise points: A noise point is any point that is neither a core point nor a border point. 
  
   - Rest of code explain is done by commenting in code itself as and when needed.
  
 ## Have a Nice Coding :+1:
